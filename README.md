BloodSource - Erasing Scarcity
# Introduction
BloodSource is a cache or a bank of blood or blood components, gathered as a result of blood donation, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion.
The term “Blood Bank” typically refers to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and proper testing of blood is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related events.
Now a days because of rise of population stand alone blood banks are the need of the hour.
# Problem Statement
Scarcity of blood is one of the major cases for loss of precious lives.
No centralized database for blood banks.
Even affluent people find it difficult to procure blood. In such a scenario, provision of safe and quality blood for the poor is unimaginable.
## On Blood Collection Side
Many parts in the country still have problem of too few voluntary donors.
The other problem is that blood donation camps do not happen all year round and the blood banks face periodic shortage.
## On Blood Bank Management Side
Lack of uniform, consistent and  up-to-date regulation and policies from the Government with the Department of Drugs and Cosmetics Standard and Control on one end and National AIDS Control organization on the other.
Struggle to compete with blood banks running with commercial motives which tend to influence the organizers of camps - especially in colleges in public blood donation drives by money and incentives.
Inability to transfer blood units between blood banks which sometimes leads to units expiring on shelf.
The difficulty in maintaining quality with low costs - especially in the context of recruiting and retaining professionals who get poached easily.
# Solution Plan
We are encouraging civilians to donate blood in government hospitals.
We are focusing on creating a singular and concrete centralized government blood bank.
To eliminate the deficit of the blood requirements which varies from time to time by building this model.
Introducing a well ordered system in receiving and providing blood which will help reducing the cost per 100ml of it.
This centralized bank will be constantly engaged with the governments “Ayush” Health care program.
Providing a centralized cum digitalized model means it will serve as a one stop destination for all your blood requirements.
Therefore we all must understand its importance and voluntarily should donate blood whenever possible and should encourage the blood banks working for the noble cause.
“If a part of blood from our body can save someone's life……..WHY NOT DONATE IT????
